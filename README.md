A plugin that uses SNMP to get error codes from a Siemens Scalance X300 or X400 switch.
The plugin outputs the fault in a human readable form,
as long as there are not several faults.


USAGE:
Add as a check in any Nagios compatible product with proper variables
The script expects either two variables for SNMPv2c or six variables for SNMPv3.
